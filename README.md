A template project for Visual Studio Code, C language running on Ubuntu 16.04

Since there is lots of step-by-step setups but no templates, I made my own template for my projects, and I am sharing it with you. Enjoy!
The template has been setup with a build task, and debugger launch file.

Versions from which the project has been compiled and tested on.

- Visual Studio Code Linux AMD64 version 1.18.0
- Visual Studio Code Extension C/C++ version 0.14.2
- Ubunut 16.04 64-bit LTS
